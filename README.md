# OMNIX.GG

**OMNIX.GG** is a premium, real-time chatting and experience-sharing platform designed specifically for gamers across the globe. Built on Next.js 15, React 19, and Google Genkit AI, it provides a centralized dashboard—a "Gaming Hub"—where players can share thoughts, coordinate gameplay in game-specific hubs, match with highly compatible squad mates using Generative AI, and securely manage their gaming handles.

##  Key Features & Use Cases

###  1. Dynamic Game Hubs
* **World Chats**: Enter game-specific channels (e.g., *Minecraft*, *Valorant*, *Elden Ring*) to join live global conversations.
* **Coordination**: Ideal for coordinate-sharing, LFG (Looking for Group) requests, and live feedback on game updates.
* **Teammate Panels**: Hub sidebars list active players currently inside the hub for instant interaction.

###  2. AI Teammate Matchmaker
* **GenAI Analysis**: Powered by Google Genkit & Gemini 2.5 Flash.
* **Custom Persona Profiles**: Players describe their gaming philosophy, style, and attitude (e.g., "chill play, team-oriented, low toxicity, entry fragger").
* **Smart Matching**: The AI analyzes preferences against other potential teammates and gives a compatibility rating along with a structured explanation of *why* they fit.

###  3. Identity Vault
* **Access Control**: Store and manage handles/IDs across multiple services (Steam, Discord, Minecraft, Valorant, etc.).
* **Granular Privacy Settings**: Configure access on a per-handle basis:
  * **Public**: Visible to all OMNIX.GG users.
  * **Mutuals Only**: Visible only to accepted teammates.
  * **Private**: Hidden from the public directory.
* **Security Logs**: Monitor who has viewed or requested access to your credentials.

###  4. Activity Feed (Experience Sharing)
* **Mini-Reviews**: Post updates, opinions, and star-rated reviews on recent play sessions.
* **Community Engagement**: Engage with other players' reviews via liking, commenting, and sharing.

###  5. Direct Messaging
